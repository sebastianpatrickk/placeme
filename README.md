This is my first working fullstack web app built with MERN stack. I wrote this code about 2 years ago when I was building a portfolio project for my High School application. It's incredible to see how much I've learned in these 2 years. While fixing this code, I kept thinking about how I could have written such terrible code, but on the other hand, I'm amazed that I was able to build this 2 years ago with almost no experience.
